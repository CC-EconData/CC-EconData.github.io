<h3> Is the advertising revenue Twitch streamers make warranted? </h3>
<br>
<container>
  </container>
<container>
  <div>
       <p>The fact that streamers make so much from advertised streams has been discussed in a number of news articles. 
         Using 2020 data from Statista and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
         Figure 1 compares the ad revenue of several top streamers to the US salaries. </p>

  <p>With this in mind, my project will be focussed on whether there is a correlation between the games streamers play on 
    Twitch and those most commonly played to see if there is any justification for this pay.

<h4><u> My data </u></h4>
<container>
   <div>
         <p> Originally, my plan was to compare games streamed and game sales. However, I ran into an issue with 
           this as I could not find monthly game sales data; only top 10 lists with most of these being in a random order. 
           My counter to this is to compare Twitch data to data on player-bases. Video games are played on many platforms such
           as Steam, Origin, and video game consoles. For the rest of this project, I focus on Steam data for player-base. 
           There are two reasons for this. Firstly, when researching I found that Steam had the best monthly data available 
           for specific games. Secondly, as Figure 2 demonstrates, the majority – 33.52% – of the top 35 games watched on 
           Twitch are mainly played on Steam.

  <p>XQC is currently one of the most popular streamers and has been for a few years. I wanted to see if there was an 
    impact on the number of average players for a game when he plays it. For this I chose the game “Turmoil”. 
    I chose Turmoil because it was a game released in June 2016. This is significant because XQC played this game in 2020 
    allowing me to see if a streamer can increase the number of players a game has even after it has been released for several years. 
    As demonstrated in figure 3, the month XQC played Turmoil – highlighted by yellow – received a massive boost in 
    average players from the previous month. While the average players did decrease after February, it remained higher 
    than before XQC played the game implying this had a lasting effect. However, this is only for one game and streamer. 
    I will now move on to analyse multiple games across Twitch.</p>

<h4><u> Analysis of the relationship between the top 5 most watched Steam games on Twitch and

  <p>Figure 4 demonstrates the Current Concurrent Players in January 2021 for the top 5 most watched Twitch 
    that are mainly played on Steam. It is these games that I decide to study for a correlation between 
    viewership and player numbers.</p>

  <br>
  <p>In figure 5, I regress average players on average viewers and do this for the months January 2019 to December 2021. 
    The regression results in an R2 value of 0.68 and a coefficient of 5.27 statistically significant at a1% level. 
    This is implies that a 1 unit increase in average viewership leads to a 5.27 unit increase in average players. 
    Thus, this indicates a strong statistically significant relationship between the two variables. 
    That is, the higher average viewers there are, the higher the number of average players there are.</p>

  <br>
  <p>The main difficulty of my project is the data I collected; that is, how representative Average Players is of the 
    number of game sales. It could just be that, in the case of Turmoil for example, a number of players who 
    originally bought the game when it first came out go back to it after a number of months due to a streamer 
    they watch playing it. This would lead to the average player count being less representative of the number 
    of sales a game has. In response to this, I decide to compare peak player count on Steam against total hours 
    watched on Twitch for several games released during the month of their release. I do this as peak players should 
    be more representative of sales here as it cannot be the case that peak players are increasing during release 
    month because people are going back to the game; it must be due to people buying the game. Figure 6 demonstrates 
    this regression. The regression results in an R2 value of 0.57 and a statistically significant coefficient at a 1% level.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<container2>
  <div>
    <p>
      To conclude, my findings imply that there is a statistically significant relationship between the games that are most watched on 
      Twitch and those most played on Steam. While there are limitations to my data due to using a proxy for game sales, the fact that there 
      is a significant relationship and similar R2 for both regression I do gives me confidence my results at least imply correlation even though 
      it is not sufficient to indicate causality.
